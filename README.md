# API Testing Framework for Reqres API (Python)

This project is a simple **API testing framework** built in Python, designed to test RESTful endpoints from [Reqres](https://reqres.in/) â€” a free, public API for practice and testing.

## Project Goal 

To create a lightweight and reusable Python-based test automation framework that:

- Covers **CRUD operations** (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Validates API **response structure** using JSON Schema
- Uses **dynamic test data** to simulate realistic input
- Generates **HTML test reports** for sharing and CI/CD use
- Can be easily extended to other APIs (like GoRest, DummyJSON, etc.)
